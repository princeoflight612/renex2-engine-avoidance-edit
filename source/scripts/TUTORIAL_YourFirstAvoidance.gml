/**
    * **Welcome to Princeoflight Avoidance Engine!**
    *
    * In this tutorial, we will be covering how to set up the engine and create your first avoidance.
    * We will also be covering basic scripts and instance functionality you can use to design your attacks.
    *
    * Let's get started!
    * 
    * **Step 1 - Import a track**
    * 
    * As the first step of making your avoidance, you should choose a music track. You can use {@link https://www.audacityteam.org/|Audacity} to cut the track as needed, as well as detect the BPM of the song.
    * Import the track by putting it into the data/music directory in your OS (NOT in GameMaker!) and then insert the name of the track into the avoidance object, as follows:
    * 
    * ``` 
    * //the music file is located in data/music and named "Avoidance.ogg";
    * //insert this code into the Create->"Set music used for the avoidance" event of objSampleAvoidance
    * musicID = "Avoidance";
    * ```
    * 
    * **Step 2 - Set up the room**
    * 
    * Next up, you should set up the avoidance object itself and the avoidance room. Make a copy of *objSampleAvoidance*, located in the Objects/Avoidance Core folder, and give it a name, like *objMyAvoidance*.
    * 
    * Then, make a copy of one of the rooms in the *Rooms/Avoidance Templates* folder. In the top left corner, you should see an instance of the object *objSampleAvoidance*. Just replace it with your new avoidance object, like *objMyAvoidance*.
    * Additionally, there should be an instance of an object *objAvoidanceDrawController*. By default, it uses additive blending for all bullets - if you want to toggle it off, go to its Creation Code and write ``additive = false``.
    * 
    * **Step 3 - Set up the avoidance object**
    *
    * After you have placed your avoidance object in the room, you should set its basic variables.
    *
    * Set the music by going to the Create->"Set music used for the avoidance" event of your new object, and changing the value of the variable musicID. As well, set the BPM you've obtained before in the same section.
    *
    * Then, set the room the player is going to be transported to after the avoidance is over. Go to the Create->"Set up end room and boss item" event to do so.
    *
    * **Step 4 - Set the attack timings**
    *
    * Attack timings are also defined in the Create event of the object, in the section "Set the attack timings". Inside, you should see something like this:
    *
    * ```
    * avoidance_add_attack("ATTACK1",0);
    * avoidance_add_attack("ATTACK2",500);
    * avoidance_add_attack("ATTACK3",1000);
    * avoidance_add_attack("END",2000);
    * ```
    *
    * The {@link avoidance_add_attack} scripts are used to define timings for your attacks, in order. You can add as many segments as you want, however, the final attack should always be named "END" - as that is what handles properly finishing the avoidance and warping the player to the end room.
    * The names of the segments will then be used in the Step event to determine which block of code corresponds to which attack.
    *
    * **Step 5 - Code the attacks**
    *
    * Finally, we can start making the attacks themselves! To do this, go to Step->"Attacks" event of your avoidance object. You will see a switch statement that looks something like this:
    *
    * ```
    * switch(ds_list_find_value(attackNames,attack)){ //Main attack loop
    *   case "ATTACK1":
    *   {
    *       //code for the attack named "ATTACK1;
    *       break;
    *   }
    *   case "ATTACK2":
    *   {   
    *       //code for attack named "ATTACK2;
    *       break;
    *   }
    *   ...
    * ```
    *
    * Here, aside from the absolute timer **gt** the event has a local variable named ``ct``, which is the **relative** timer, counted **from the start of the current attack**. It is recommended to use the latter, and set attack start timings in the Create event (see Step 4).
    * You can use the {@link on_beat} function to execute blocks of code every X frames, for example,
    * ```
    * //This code spawns a flower from the center of the screen every beat. The bullets are tagged "flower" which can then be used to manipulate them selectively afterwards
    * if(on_beat(ct,BT)){
    *   spawn_shape(400,304, random(360),6,36,6,objAvoidanceBullet,"flower",shaper_flower);
    * }
    * ```
    *
    *
    *
    * **Step 6 - Debugging and playtesting**
    *
    * When playing the game in debug mode, a timeline will appear on top of the screen, with the attack timings marked. Clicking on it will allow you to instantly skip to any given timing on the avoidance. This is very useful for debugging and playtesting the game, where you often need to test attacks individually.
    *
    * **Conclusion**
    *
    * With that, your first avoidance is now done! Feel free to experiment with different styles of visuals and attacks, as well as all of the different scripts featured in the engine!
